Readme.md
===========

This file is a readme file for the Course Project of the Getting and Cleaning Data September 2014.

The program "runanalysis.R" reads the train and the test dataset and combines them into one according to the five steps specified in the Course Project.

* Step 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Step 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Step 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Step 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* Step 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

All the files are assumed to be stored in the current working directory. By executing the program, it outputs a file named "aggregated.txt" in the current working directory. 

Please refer to the comment in the program for any detailed information about how it computes the output.
